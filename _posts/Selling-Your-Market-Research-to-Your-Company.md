Working for a startup, and having to juggle multiple commitments, I've had to become adept at selling my research methodology to the company's leadership on numerous occasions. 

I illustrate my approach to answering some of the key concerns that diverse stakeholders may raise at a company, using specific phrases that leadership has used to set the vision for research. For each concern, I discuss what the implications are on research outcomes. 

"This research is critical for us at this time, but it is low-hanging fruit."

CMO: We have a vision for research, as well as a set of methods we want you to use. Namely, 30-minute interviews and a big sample size. 

As an anthropologist and social scientist, this was a hard one to swallow at first. While marketers are comfortable with anecdotal evidence of niche practices, they rely mostly on surveys and questionnaires -- on self-reports -- as a proxy for an existing set of human behaviors. 

To this, I responded: Formal interviews are known to limit the wide range of responses, which could be probed with further context. I would use this strategy to suss out the context: bring an expert with you to the interviews; respondents may just agree to share more the more you know about the cultural milieu in which they operate. 

This means, that we do not need a big sample size, either. Asking more open-ended questions may just be your ticket, and a size of 5 to 8 is sufficient to preliminary research if the goal is to get to the few wants, needs and pain points that they experience in their role. 

"We do not want to piss in our own river."

CMO: I personally know these brands and do not need their business contexts. I believe we can get buy-in from them later.

Earlier that week, I had received two conflicting, but not mutually exclusive, directions from my CCO and CMO regarding my research. One required that I focused on customer segmentation exclusively for the purpose of getting more users to adopt our wallet and the other demanded that I developed brand and shopper-level taxonomies that any department (marketing, product and sales) could use as needed. 

Upon submitting a list of broad interview questions that I wanted to ask of my CMO's brand contacts, my CMO called my CCO and convinced him to wait on brands. I played the devil's advocate then: if I agreed to 'no interviews yet', could we imagine an alternative where I would not, for lack of better language, piss on our own river? 

Given that a lot of this research was green (and, in a lot of cases, proprietary), I now had to supply new methods of collecting the data:

- less intrusive methods: use data that was already produced on our end. If we used this research to fuel wallet adoption, key demographic information as well as general attitudes towards our wallet could be gleaned from our Telegram chats with interested users. Which on-boarding strategy was left murky. 

- secondary research from demographic information published by other crypto wallet startups about their users. 

I insisted that we triangulate sources of data. Once the secondary research on shopping behaviors was done -- and I argued then, that this research needed to focus on a set of interactions surrounding a host of technologies, so it could speak to the wallet -- we would revisit more direct forms of interviewing and have me open up other channels for collecting data (read next). I could save us time and cost by using a comparative approach and interviewing a small subset of the population, our control group, against which to extrapolate more unique insights. 

My hunch was, that we could save on time and cost by being comparative and extrapolating unique insights from a small subset of the population with whom we had rapport. 

"We want you to be as broad as possible. There are standups to get updated on progress throughout the company."

Me: You possess inside knowledge of the retail workflow. You can help me think of more pertinent questions to ask. 

CCO: Yes, but you know people. You as a social scientist have frameworks that can help build a more comprehensive database of brand/shopper personas. 

The main issue I saw with this response is, that I need to work with raw data. I would not be able to read e-mail responses to our Director of Sales's cold outreach efforts. Although these answers are almost always scripted, and I do not get to sit in a company room as key constituents debate how to present themselves strategically to us, some of the questions that brands and shoppers may ask of other employees at my startup are invaluable sources of data for me precisely because they haven't been diluted by the paradigms that my co-workers may use to make sense of their responses.  

"Accompany me to build rapport."

CCO: Yes! 

There are just a few things that get marketing professionals fired up about research. As per their choice of research project, the prospect of owning their own database of customer insights was one. This last commentary from my CCO highlights the importance of rapport in this line of work.

I may write a separate blog post on what rapport entails for them. Within the scope of negotiating research objectives, the implications were that marketers and marketing researchers often default to a set of methods that they consider valid from experience, or to be appropriate in working inside the parameters of the organization. Methods like increasing the sample size, or broadening the scope in this case, or preferring to rely on secondary research in proprietary databases (e.g. Forrester) instead of conducting contextual interviews with stakeholders.  

Corporate anthropologists are accustomed to the give and take. Most importantly, they learn to relinquish some of the autonomy that I, too, enjoyed in graduate school and deal with these discrepancies in thinking one by one. In this journey, I've had to get leadership talking to one another, addresss some of their concerns around biases and offering to revisit other sources of data at a later stage. Most importantly, I emphasize that anecdotal evidence to which they are accustomed is valid insomuch as the context can be reliably recorded.

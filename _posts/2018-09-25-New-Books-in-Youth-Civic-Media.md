After Rafi Santos' essay on youths' critical "hacker" media literacies, this book makes a much-needed contribution to research on this new trend of "connected journalism" - with, at its center, youths deciding what constitutes news. In the process, becoming more adept at teasing fake news.

I am not a fan of this book for the argument it makes. Jill Koyama and Herve Varenne have written extensively on the corporations behind NLCB's most profitable tutoring industry, as does this ethnography discussing the actor-networks behind the latest wave of school reform centered on video games in education. I'd recommend reading Aaron Hung's "The Work of Play," Mizuko Ito's chapter on the sociocultural aspects of game-based learning in Karen Salen's "The Ecology of Games", Tom Boellstorff's "Coming of Age in Second Life" before tackling this one.

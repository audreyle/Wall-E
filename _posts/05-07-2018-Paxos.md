Scenarios to watch out for:

PARALLELISM

1. The learner is confused as to what the value the group of acceptors agreed upon.

This happens when any two proposers sends an 'accept' message at the same time. The acceptor receives the first message it receives, but there is no guarantee that any proposer will reach all acceptors befor the other.

ORDERING

2. A promise message reaches the acceptors in an inconvenient order.

This happens when you use proposals. The acceptor rejects another proposer's proposal message because it has already accepted the promise message of a first proposer, resulting in a stalemate.

Note: A proposal is defined by a pair (sequence number, proposer name).

COMPETITION

3. A new bid is automatically rejected because acceptors do not have the capacity to accept more than one value. 

This happens when an acceptor promises to accept a proposal if it has the highest proposal number it has yet seen. 

COOPERATION 

4. Let's say that once a value has been accepted by some acceptors. The acceptors can still accept a new proposal from other proposers if the latter sees that the same value was chosen (just with a different and higher numbered proposal).

Technicalities.

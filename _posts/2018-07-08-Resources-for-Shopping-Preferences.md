As I'm unrolling the first iteration of my shopper database at EVERY*, I thought I'd share some of my go-to resources and how I used them.

## Getting Started

To get a holistic picture of shoppers' preferences, you will have to play with the age-old axes of segmentation (e.g. age, income, gender, ethnicity and region) to see which ones are interesting/relevant. 

There is a wealth of resources for persona work, especially in the luxury/travel and millenial beauty segments. You could start to get basic information on shopper's value orientation and eventually decide whether quality trumps price, or comfort. In our case, we were also interested in their technographics in the wake of the EU's adoption of stricter data privacy laws.

|SOURCE | MEASUREMENTS, TYPE OF DATA | USE |

## Process of Segmentation

Upon updating the Sales team and Marketing, it became clear that to optimize brand outreach we needed to zero in on a few categories of products. Our new CMO, previously Head of Global Marketing at Amazon, was interested in cross-merchandising and instructed me to focus on shopping behaviors in the lifestyle/home goods, beauty/personal hygiene, and apparel/accessories sections of a store. Our Director of Marketing then hacked away at these categories with competitive intelligence: when I presented him with a list fo lifestyle goods and services to approve, he subtracted travel because airlines had already championed loyalty/mileage programming. Given that most of the brands signing on to our own loyalty tokenization program were streetwear apparel companies (the first targeted), he limited food categories to those that were consumed by athleisure shoppers. 

The process of designing the taxonomy was messy, to say the least. I did not completely give up persona work where I found it useful to get basic demographic variables in. But wherever context was missing, I started playing with age cohorts to unveil differences in consumer preferences in response to the retailer's strategy (new trends and experiences). 

On a final note, I keep to my CMO's word of advice: to be wary of the in-store, online shopping binary. Many shoppers, regardless of age, will research product information online. Just as retailers regardless of type will indulge shopper demand for vintage trends. It is merely a matter of %'s (coming up).

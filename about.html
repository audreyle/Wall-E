title: About Me
---

<p>
	I currently work as a cryptographer for a blockchain startup based in Seattle, WA. My day-to-day is closer to a Product Owner's: I write the specifications for our wallet and decentralized data exchange protocol, but I also use my training as a cultural anthropologist to research market demands for our products.

	I received my PhD in Digital Anthropology from Columbia University in 2017. Originally, I planned to do a postdoc in Europe on digital governance, identity, and data privacy. In the middle, I got poached to work on a real business use-case in retail. I am passionate about quintessential issues in cybersecurity and discovering hidden cultural niches. My passions only to be superseded by a love of data in all of its permutations and a desire to help children be their best selves.

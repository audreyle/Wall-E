Working for a startup, and having to juggle multiple commitments, I've had to become adept at selling my research methodology to the company's leadership on numerous occasions. 

I illustrate my approach to answering some of the key concerns that diverse stakeholders may raise at a company, using specific phrases that leadership has used to set the vision for research. For each concern, I discuss what the implications are on research outcomes. 

### "This research is critical for us at this time, but it is low-hanging fruit."

> CMO: We have a vision for research, as well as a set of methods we want you to use. Namely, 30-minute interviews and a big sample size. 

While my peers in marketing were open to a more processual, grounded approach, in outlining our goals for research I became aware of the dominance of surveys and questionnaires in their field. 

Formal interviews tend to limit a wide range of expressions, which can be probed with more context. My advice was, in this case, to bring an expert with to the interviews. This meant that we do not need a big sample size, either. The more one knew about a client's context, the more assured the researcher can be that s/he is getting to the meat of an issue of interest to both parties. 

### "We do not want to piss in our own river."

> CMO: I personally know these brands and do not need their business contexts. I believe we can get buy-in from them later.

Earlier that week, I had received two conflicting, but not mutually exclusive, directions from my CCO and CMO regarding my research. One had requested that I focused on customer segmentation exclusively for the purpose of getting more users to adopt our wallet and the other had asked that I developed brand and shopper-level taxonomies that any department (marketing, product and sales) could use as needed. 

I played devil's advocate then, and proposed to use data we already had: 

- **less intrusive**: If using this research to fuel wallet adoption, general attitudes towards our wallet could be gleaned from our Telegram chats with interested users. But since our community leads' on-boarding strategy was unclear at the time, we quickly decided that this avenue of research was not worth pursuing. 

- **competitive benchmarking*** from demographic information published by other crypto wallet startups about their users.  

Until we were ready to run usability tests, it was decided then that we would ignore our current audience. We did not want another crypto wallet user, but the everyday retail consumer who was already familiar with different ecommerce wallets. 

### "We want you to be as broad as possible. There are standups to get updated on progress throughout the company."

> Me: You possess inside knowledge of the retail workflow. You can help me think of more pertinent questions to ask. 

> CCO: Yes, but you know people. You as a social scientist have frameworks that can help build a more comprehensive database of brand/shopper personas. 

The main issue I saw with this response is, that the researcher does not hear from the actual buyer. The Head of Sales does, once she had a handle on what brands wanted out of our loyalty tokenization program, could summarize them to our company, but some of paradigms that clients used to interpret the value of our products may be lost in translation. 

### "Accompany me to build rapport."

> CCO: Yes! 

There are just a few things that get marketing professionals fired up about research. As per their choice of research project, the prospect of owning their own database of customer insights was one. This last commentary from my CCO highlights the importance of rapport in this line of work.

As I'm unrolling the first iteration of my shopper database at EVERY*, I thought I'd share some of my go-to resources.  

Secondary research is a relatively cheap and quick way to gather insights on retail consumer preferences. It was very tempting to want to outline my top axes for segmentation early on, but I soon found how incomplete (either unavailable, or criss-crossed) that information was! 

The premise of this research was to compile a list of all shoppers' wants, needs and pain points. As more brands signed on, it became imperative that my team prioritized the lifestyle, apparel and beauty sections of a store.

To cross-merchandise, and stop us from indulging in the old binary in-store/online divide, I would not completely give us persona work where I found it useful to get basic demographic variables in. But wherever context was missing, I started playing with age cohorts to unearth retailer and customer strategies, and value orientations.
